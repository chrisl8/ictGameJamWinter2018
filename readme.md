# Push The Button

Game created for the 2018 Winter ICT Game Jam.

This game was a physical game, in that it was built with an Arduino and lots of buttons and switches.
You won't really be able to play it without building something.

# Archive

This is an Archive repository, left in the exact state that we turned in our submission for the game jam. It will not be updated.
The currently maintained version is called Panic Stations, which you can see here: https://github.com/chrisl8/PanicStations

# Premise

In the Twenty-Fourth and a Halfth Century humanity has expanded across the galaxy. There are many special people with heroic tasks to accomplish. There are also a lot of mundane tasks that we thought robots would be doing by now, but the the robots have better things to do . . . or perhaps you are a robot, that is also a possibility.
You have one job: push the button . . . buttons . . . and turn the knobs and flip the switches.
