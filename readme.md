# Push The Button

Game created for the 2018 Winter ICT Game Jam.

This game is a physical game, in that it is built with an Arduino and lots of buttons and switches.
You won't really be able to play it without building something.

# Premise

In the Twenty-Fourth and a Halfth Century humanity has expanded across the galaxy. There are many special people with heroic tasks to accomplish. There are also a lot of mundane tasks that we thought robots would be doing by now, but the the robots have better things to do . . . or perhaps you are a robot, that is also a possibility.
You have one job: push the button . . . buttons . . . and turn the knobs and flip the switches.
